# Zombies

A fully self-contained, portable, digital implementation of the solitaire game
[Zombie in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33468/zombie-my-pocket).

Like the original, this digital version is meant to be taken with you anywhere!
This means everything necessary to play the game is included in the
[zombie_in_my_pocket.html](https://rawgit.com/PatrickKennedy/zombies/master/zombie_in_my_pocket.html) file in the root directory. It can be put in dropbox,
on a USB drive, even on a floppy disk if you swing that way.

## How To Play
 * Step 1: Download or bookmark this link: https://rawgit.com/PatrickKennedy/zombies/master/zombie_in_my_pocket.html
 * There is no step 2!

All the information necessary to play is available in the
[original pdf rulebook](https://github.com/PatrickKennedy/zombies/blob/master/Zombie_in_my_Pocket.pdf).
